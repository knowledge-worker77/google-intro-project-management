## Project initiation
Successfully starting a new project and making sure it goes smoothly is a huge undertaking. If the foundation for your project is laid out correctly then rest of the project will be a smooth sail.

Project initiation begins when a problem or a new opportunity has been found in the organization.  Projects are initiated by senior managers and stakeholders that either want to increase productivity, remove a flaw, or create a new product or service that the organization will provide to its customers.

The project managers role in this is to identify the main goals, resources and other details  of the project.  Clear communication with the stakeholders is the most important step in the initiation phase to make sure there is no mistake in communication and everyone is on the same page. 

The project manager also has to define all the required resources and the suggested outcome for this project. They can use a process called the cost-benefit analysis that is the process of comparing the successful outcomes of the process to the price that they costed.

## key components of starting a project

A successful project initiation has several key factors that are needed to be discussed in the beginning so that the project can be successful.

The first thing that you need to consider is the end-goal of the project, what exactly should the outcome be of this project that you're gonna start.

After setting the goals pf the project you need to  define the scope of the project how and what work is needed to be done and when. What work should be delivered to whom and who are people responsible for that.

The scope defines the deliverables, stakeholders, and team members involved in the project. Defining the scope helps with setting up a success criteria for the project. A success criteria is a measure of the successful impact that a project has had on the organization and whether it was successful or not 

The stake holders in the project are the people that are interested in the project or the project affects them in one or more ways.

The success of a project can also be measured by how the reaction of the stakeholders is after its completion. Stake holders are also the people that are sometimes responsible for allocations of resources required for the project so you need to keep in mind the goals and objectives of each stakeholder as well.

After all of this is done you will need to create a document known as a project charter that lists all of the requirements for the project in a formal matter and present it to all of the stakeholders and team members. The project charter needs to approved by the stakeholders so that we can move on to the planning stage.
