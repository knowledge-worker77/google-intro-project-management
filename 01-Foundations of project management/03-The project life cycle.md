## Project life cycle
Not every project will be the same, some of them will be but some will be completely new experience for you. This means that you'll need to plan each project with a slightly different approach and there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for all projects.

If the life cycle is planned correctly then the project will continue on the path decided smoothly. Project life cycles have four major phases, all of which have their own requirements and tasks to be completed.

## Phases of the project life cycle
The main phases are starting the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and completing the project and delivering the final deliverable to the shareholders or the customer.

The first phase, initiation acts as a base for all the upcoming phases and the pre-requisites we need to do before starting the project.  We define the end goals, budget, team members, resources, final deliverables, and any other details that we might require further down the plan in this phase.

The second phase is planning, you'll need to plan everything if you want to meet your goals on time and within budget. Dividing the budget and the required tasks between team members, and resources is done when planning.

The third phase involves communicating effectively and recording the progress of the tasks that were assigned to each member and removing any obstacles that comes in your way.

The final phase involves closing the project when all of the tasks have been completed and the final deliverables have been shipped to the user. You and your team should celebrate all of the hard work that you have done. Evaluating the outcome of the project and the areas where you and the team can improve should be discussed at this phase.

## Project management methodologies
Different projects needs different type of methodologies to be successful. A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle.

Project management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall.

There are two types of project methodologies that are commonly used in the industry which are linear and iterative. In a linear approach the current task has to be completed 100% before we can move on to the next step. While, in an iterative process we can move back and forth between different phases easily.

## Waterfall and Agile
- Waterfall: The waterfall methodology was invented in the 70s and by the name given, we work in a way how water falls down a waterfall once you past a step you cannot go back to it. This approach can be categorized as a linear approach.
- Agile: The agile methodology offer great flexibility to move from one phase to another and backwards as well. You can modify each part according to your needs wherever you're on your project journey. It was invented in the 90s but was named agile in 2001. It is based on weekly progress called sprints.

## Lean method
The Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production. 

Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits.

The lean method consists of five-steps or pillars as they are called which consists of the following:

- Sorting all of the required items and removing all unwanted things.
- Arrange familiar things in order and label them accordingly.
- Keeping everything in the correct place and cleaning your workplace and tools every day.
- Performing the process every day.
- Make the above points into a habit and teach every member of your team also.

## Six sigma
Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

Unlike the name the six sigma approach has seven main principles:

- Focus on the customer
- Learn how the work is actually done.
- Remove hurdles from your process.
- Reduce waste and focus on value.
- Remove defects by removing variation.
- Collaborate with others.
- Approach everything in a systematic way.

## Lean six sigma
Aside from waterfall and agile there is also another project management methodology that you can learn about called the Lean Six Sigma approach. This method is a combination of the Lean and Six Sigma methods.

The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment.

The main idea behind the lean six sigma method is that when your team feels valued and motivated their productivity increases automatically.

The lean six sigma method has five steps, which include measuring, analyzing, improving, and controlling or we can say DMAIC for short. DMAIC focuses on finding the problems in current problems and fixing them so that the team can work smoothly. 

> Lean six sigma is similar to waterfall and agile but it can be used to solve any kind of business problems.
