## Adding value
Project managers are responsible for everything that is related to the project they are assigned to from guiding their team members to making sure there are no roadblocks in the road map of the project, all deadlines are met, and the project adds value to business or customer after its completion.

Project managers are responsible for figuring out which tasks should be assigned to whom and which task should be the top priority. Assigning tasks to the right person is also something that a project manager should have, if you give the marketing part of the project to any other department then the project won't get as much attention from the public because the people that you assigned the marketing to aren't good at it.

Assigning tasks also means to regularly check up on their progress and make sure there isn't anything upsetting or wrong so that team members don't feel overworked, tired, or annoyed and the project also stays on track.

## Managing teams
As a project manager you'll work with people from all of the different departments in your company and will act as a guide for them.  Cross functional teams have many T-shaped professionals, people who are knowledgeable about many things but are specialists in certain areas.

The best approach to working with cross-functional teams is that you need to be super good at communicating with your team members. Making sure that they can understand you correctly and you understand their problems correctly.

You also need to clarify the goals you want to achieve from this project and to do that you'll need to pick the right team members so that they can help you in reaching that goal. Keep measuring your team-mates performance and appreciate them so that they feel more motivated.

## Core skills
Collaborative decision making: Make sure when you start the project and are deciding on the plan of action then everyone in your team should be present at that meeting and they should be able to voice out their opinions so that you can get more diverse perspectives about the project and its goals. 

When your teammates will have a part in the overall decision making procedure it will make them feel more empowered and accountable for their role and the tasks that are assigned to them.

- Communicating: The key factor in a successful team is that it requires a great amount of effective communication and knowing when to escalate certain issues is important to keep your team on the path to success.
- Organization: Organization is also a skill that every project manager should have. Managing all the required information about the project and planning in one place so that it's accessible by everyone is a great way to speed things up.
- Being flexible and handling change: In the planning stage of the project make sure there are other alternatives to each technology, method, or tool you are going to work with so that if it goes down you can start using the other one without any friction.

You also need to be a little more flexible with your deadlines and be ready to accept any kind of change that happens in the project and be ready to adapt to it.
