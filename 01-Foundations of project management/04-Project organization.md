## Organizational structures
In each team that you work in you’ll have a different role and each role will also have different responsibilities.  Each company will have their own organizational structures and this will tell you how a company is arranged and how it performs.

The organizational structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another.

Organizational structures can serve as a map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to communicate with them. 

## Classic and matrix structures
The classic structure is like how most organizations are arranged, there is the CEO at the top and then below him are the managers and other executives and then there are the workers.  The classic structure is also known as the top-down structure and is kind of like how the army works.

The matrix structure is where you report to those above you but also to those who are at the same level as you since multiple teams are working in parallel and need to updated about each teams work and progress. The matrix structure is like a grid where every role and department is inter-connected.

## Organizational structures and management
An organizational structure helps project managers by providing them a framework for accountability and communication to the people that they need to report to.  Each company has its own structure and knowing it will be a great help for reporting the statuses of tasks and managing resources that are required in the project that you're leading.

Organizational structures also tell the project manager how much authority they have over the project and what are the things that they can change without consulting any one else. This won't be the case all the time since a project manager most of the time has to look for the approval of shareholders to move forward with any major changes.

> The key is to make sure you know who your stakeholders are and who controls.

## Organizational culture
The culture of each organization differs to one to another but it tells you about the things that the employees at an organization value, how they work, and how the organization operates. Some definitions emphasize teamwork and innovation,  while others focus on attention to detail and achievement.

Understanding the culture of the organization that you're working with will help you manage your team better and make them more likely to accomplish the goals that they have set.

Understanding the organizational culture will also tell you how to interact with the stake holders and upper management and how to interact with each member of your team so that you can complete the project without any conflict or hassle.

## Change management
When working on internal projects the project manager has to make sure that the people in the organization understand the completed project and can easily adapt to it. Company culture plays a vital role in the adaption of new tools and processes.

Change management has three core principles that are considered best practices for  organizations.

- The first being creating a sense of ownership and understanding the project's urgency.
- The second being making sure that you find out the right responsibilities to give to the right people on your team so that they can be more productive.
- The final one is the most important and its clear communication between team members so that everyone is on the same page,

You won't be fully responsible in bringing a new change to your organization since you're only the project manager and if the project is over seen by upper level management and stake holders then they will decide to implement the change or not. Your job is to make sure that the project finishes successfully and before its deadline.
